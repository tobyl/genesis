Dear Suppliers and Customers,

Following the rules and regulations set by the Prime Minister last night regarding the health and safety for COVID-19, we have decided to close the Genesis office for 3 weeks.

If you have any questions or queries, please do not hesitate to call or email.

We hope you all remain safe and healthy during this uncertain time, and hopefully we will be back up and running soon.

We apologise for any inconveniences caused by this.

Kind regards

Genesis Games Team
